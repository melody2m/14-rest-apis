## Overview
We are trying to understand and complete comment tasks on this pre-built lab, which involves querying google books api and creating a local database of books. 

## Getting Started
The user has to download the lab and then go through it, trying to trace why various methods have been built.

## Architecture
This lab is built with express dependencies, superagent, jquery, handlebars, and of course javascript/html.
